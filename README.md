Presentation:Jupyter Notebook

Dataset:Kaggle

This Project was made to demonstrate how critical thinking can be used to quickly analyze, clean and use a dataset to train a machine learning algorithm to achieve statistically significant and important results. (In this example I do not use parameter tuning).


I made this to show my personal way of thinking, how I used python and what steps I took to try to gain meaningful insight into questions I found myself asking about the dataset. 


This project was made with open source data taken from Kaggle. All conclusions, analysis and code was done by me but I highly encourage people to add their own code/analysis.
